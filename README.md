# password-generator

This project generates a password at random, based on criteria given by a user. To start press the "generate password" button. An input box appears where the user is prompted the desired number of charachters for the password between 10 and 63 (if the number is outside this range, the user is prompted again). The user then selects the character types they want their password to contain. The following options are available:

* Uppercase Characters  (ABCDEFGHI...)
* Lowercase Characters  (abcdefjhi...)
* Numerical Characters  (1234567890)
* Special Characters    (!@#$%^&*-_=:;\)

The user must select at least one character type - if they do not, they will be prompted again

The password is then displayed in the text area on the screen
